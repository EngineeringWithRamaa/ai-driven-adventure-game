AI-Powered Adventure Game: Dynamic Storytelling with RAG and Vector Embeddings

# In few words 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) proves instrumental in the adventure game by enhancing the storytelling experience. RAG combines retrieval-based and generative techniques of LLM models, allowing the OpenAI model to retrieve relevant information from a database (Vector Embeddings in this case) and generate context-aware responses. This dynamic approach ensures that the generated narratives align with the user's choices, creating a more personalized and coherent gaming experience.
